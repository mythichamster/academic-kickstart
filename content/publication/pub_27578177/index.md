abstract: MicroRNAs and siRNAs, both of which are AGO-bound small RNAs, are essential for mammalian spermatogenesis. Although their precise germline roles remain largely uncharacterized, recent discoveries suggest that they function in mechanisms beyond microRNA-mediated post-transcriptional control, playing roles in DNA repair and transcriptional regulation within the nucleus. Here, we discuss the latest findings regarding roles for AGO proteins and their associated small RNAs in the male germline. We integrate genetic, clinical and genomics data, and draw upon findings from non-mammalian models, to examine potential roles for AGO-bound small RNAs during spermatogenesis. Finally, we evaluate the emerging and differing roles for AGOs and AGO-bound small RNAs in the male and female germlines, suggesting potential reasons for these sexual dimorphisms.
