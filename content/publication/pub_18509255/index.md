abstract: Tight junctions are composed of claudins, occludins, junctional adhesion molecules and plaque proteins. Claudin 2 protein forms a cation-selective channel which confers increased permeability in renal epithelial cells and in the intestine where its expression is restricted to the leaky epithelium. Immunohistochemical staining revealed claudin 2 staining in the granular layer of adult epidermis. Analysis of Western blots revealed bands corresponding to the molecular weight of claudin 2 in Madin-Darby canine kidney II cells, human kidney, adult skin and neonatal keratinocytes. Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction on mRNA and cDNA sequence analysis found a 99% sequence homology between our cDNA and human claudin 2 (NIH BLAST sequence). Further, we show that all-trans-retinoic acid increases the expression of claudin 2 in keratinocytes in a dose-dependent manner. The discovery of claudin 2 transcript and protein in the skin could be of importance in epidermal differentiation, barrier function and pathological conditions.
