Stephanie Hilz is a post-doctoral fellow in cancer genomics at the Costello Lab in UCSF's Department of Neurological Surgery. Her most recent project integrates "omics" and imaging data to uncover therapeutically relevant patterns of cellular heterogeneity in a currently incurable type of brain tumor, adult diffuse glioma. From this project, she hopes to better understand how different subtypes of diffuse glioma evolve, as well as how the patterns of this evolution impact their amenability to different types of targeted therapy. 

Her long term goal is to leverage a more nuanced understanding of what makes tumor cells different from the remaining cells in our body to develop more effective strategies to target and eliminate them.
